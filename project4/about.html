      <p id="about">My name is Yusuf Reyaz. I am a designer based out of Maryland, with experience working with full-stack development, UX/UI design and graphic design. I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Digital Media and Web Technology from UMGC, with a minor in business administration. I work with the Vidya Setu Foundation as their Director of Design, to design the website, develop graphics and promotional material, and maintain an overall digital design strategy.
      In my free time I enjoy street photography, video games, and watching basketball. </p>
