    <td><h2>Geico Mobile UX Redesign</h2>
    <p>For this prework assignment, I was charged with redesigning the GEICO mobile interface with UX principles in mind. I created a mockup with the required elements, and ordered them on the screen by how likely a user is to interact with them. I chose colors that correpsond with the options, and tried to keep the brightest colors for the most urgent options.</p></td>

    <td><h2>RoboRecruiter</h2><p>For this project, we built a web application that can automate preliminary job search aspects, such as resume screening, scheduling, and more. To design this we took into account both the needs of the job candidates and the employers. Using our analysis, we created an interface that easily allows to prospective employees to upload resumes, apply for jobs and check application status.</p></td>
