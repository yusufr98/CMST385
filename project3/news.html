            <p class="text">Top Dawg Entertainment president Punch has hinted that new music from Kendrick Lamar could be on the way soon.<br><br>
              The rapper hasn’t released an album since 2017’s ‘Damn.’, with his only new music since appearing on the Black Panther soundtrack. <br><br>
              Podcast host Karen Civil extended an invitation to Punch on Twitter to come on her podcast Girl I Guess, asking at the same time: “Can we play that new Kendrick you played me?”<br><br>
              “YES!” Punch replied. “Soon.” See the interaction below now.<br><br>

            <p class="text">The Kendrick Lamar, Dave Free, and Baby Keem-aligned enigma that is pgLang continues to simultaneously build hype and confusion for fans. From working with Calvin Klein to appearing in The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights
              (Remix)"
              music video, the record label meets creative agency has been making major moves over the past year, but fans are really waiting to see what this means musically for Kendrick Lamar.<br><br>
              One thing that has remained consistent throughout all pgLang-related news, however, is that Kendrick Lamar and his cousin Baby Keem will be at the forefront of whatever the mysterious company has been working on. Last fall, the two
              artists covered i-D Magazine and essentially confirmed that fans should be getting really excited for what pgLang has in store, from Baby Keem's growth to Kendrick's new sound.<br><br>
